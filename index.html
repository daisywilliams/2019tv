                        <p> 019 was the year of the hot priest. Andrew Scott’s character came into our lives, made us cum and then left us weeping (but still wet). Fleabag had a phenomenal season one, something many believed couldn’t be matched and wasn’t necessary. We knew her secret, our relationship to the protagonist had shifted. Season two evolved the audience and PWB’s title characters connection. The best moment of all the golden ones from this holy man was the moment he screamed at the camera. Not only is its comedic timing impeccable, but it is a key moment to indicate he is seeing her for who she is, he is breaking her walls and in turn the fourth walls.

                        <p> eason one of Barry was much watch television. Season two is unmissable. The show is what Breaking Bad was at its best, a true dramedy. A cast of complex characters mixed in with some honest moments of heartbreak mixed in with tension breaking comedy. So many shows have lost what it means to be a dramedy and lean to heavy on the drama side. Barry isn’t one of these. Bill Hader brings some absurd humor from his <i> South Park </i> days and Alec Berg brings the situational humor from <i>Seinfeld </i>. The fight scenes are intense whilst being comedic, which is a harder task than it sounds. Jessie Giacomazzi, who plays Lily, stunts and intensity are extraordinary, unparallel to any child actor on TV at the moment (sorry Iain Armitage I love you)

                        <p> he fact mainstream culture has embraced mayor Pete and not this scene as a ~gay icon~ is truly homophobic. I gagged when I saw this. And not in a basic white woman appropriation of ‘I’m gagging’, I chocked on my butter chicken and nearly threw up this scene shocked and thrilled me so much. I literally nearly died. This is a credit scene that is a direct parody of Call You By My Names final scene but instead we have a much cuter tw**k than Timothée Chalamet in Drew Traver. Molly Shannon provides dialogue that mimics every conversation I’ve had with my mother about movies. The Other Two is my 2019 sleeper hit that I believe everyone should watch. It has become a new pseudo litmus test for me; if someone says they relates to the main characters, I instantly know they are my friends; if they don’t, I know they are either liars or lame. Everyone should watch The Other Two, but this credit scene should be taught in schools as iconic cinema.

Black Lady Sketch Show fits into this and excels. It is at it’s very best in this sketch. A drag ball for the basic bitches out there. Season depression faces SNATCHED. An appearance from one of my of my favorite queens of all time, Miss purse first herself, Bob The Drag Queen, a collapse/death drop and a visual representation of every facet of ones ‘basic bitchdom’ this moment deserves 10’s, 10’s, 10’s across the board hunty.

                        <p> here are three examples of characters as best moments of the shows. Renata from Big Little Lies is one of them, Robin is my next one and down the list SNL’s newest addition is the final one. I feel like I cheated putting people as a moment, but I do believe they truly encompass the spirit of the show they star in. Robin however, Stranger Things could exist without her, it wouldn’t suffer a significant amount, but a level of maturity and depth would be taken from the show. Her relationship with Steve breaks the tropes of the manic pixie dream girl in a jarring but necessary way. She brings a mainstream lesbian character into the zeitgeist of Netflix characters whose personality isn’t ‘I am gay’. Maya Hawk portrayal is real above all and there is still room for me to be in season four as her best friend who kiss on weekends but eventually marries Steve.

                        <p> ondheim, Mulaney, A song about cocaine. What more do you want in an episode? Documentary Now has been an underrated gem from the minds of Fred Armisen, Bill Hader and Seth Meyers for the past four years. The IFC show has had some season highs this year from Bathshit Valley and Cate Blanchett ridiculous performance as the truly insane artist. But, Coop The Musical is the peak of satire, mockumentary and parody this year. It gives you hits like ‘I Gotta Go’ and ‘Holiday Party (I Did a Little Cocaine Tonight)’ but nothing can beat Richard Kind’s specular performance of ‘Christmas Tips’, a song that epitomizes everything Sondheim is. I stan one person and one person only. Richard Kind. I met him after Kiss Me Kate where I freaked the fuck out.

                        <p>aya Erskine and Anna Konkle’s show is a time capsule of growing up in the 2000s – it is nostalgic but also makes you so thankful you are past it. The best moment from this show comes from the AIM episode. It gave me every painful flashback to the days where I would sit on the home computer and just wait for ‘sup’. The time I put a popular girls name with a heart in my IM and she changed hers and didn’t put mine. The time I went on Habbo hotel and made a boyfriend and he asked me to bobba (which was the word for any curse word) and I said yes I want to bobba and then logged off and cried because I didn’t want to lose my virginity that way! I know I mainly spoke about my experiences in this moment, however this is the glory of this show, it transports you back into the excruciating pain that the early 2000’s bought many of us and is so painfully and embarrassingly relatable.

                        <p>f I had to describe the emotion of bliss without using a word, I would play this scene. An outstanding achievement of a wordless scene with a clear emotional journey. Aidy Bryant left me in tears. This scene resonates if you have ever felt a slither of self-doubt about yourself, and the freedom of releasing those fears. Shrill, and this scene in particular, is for the big girls. This show is not just a celebration of them, but for them. I think one who watches this show and thinks her pain comes from her weight has missed the point of the show. Annie still has the same dating, family and work issues – none exclusively occurring because of her size, but she has the societal pressures of body image on top of an already demanding life as a female. Shrill is a show that shouldn’t be written off because it’s ‘not for you’. Lindy West writes it in a way that you can see fragments of yourself in it. Or maybe you can’t, and you can just learn to not be an asshole and enjoy a show.

                        <p>left Game of Thrones off this list for many reasons. The characters are too hard to draw, in and of itself it wasn’t at its peak, it didn’t have any good moments to include, etc etc. But the main reason I excluded it because on show gave us the ending that Thrones promised. One about power corrupting, characters getting the endings they deserved and ultimately heartbreaking betrayal. Veep was this show. The ultimate combination of these came in the form of Gary and Selena’s last moments where she throws him under the bus, and he takes the hit for a crime he didn’t commit. You say, “remember when Jon Snow stabs Daenerys” and I say talk to me after the pain of watching Gary be stabbed in the back like that. Veep serves as a near perfect comedy, but it’s moments of hauntingly painful truths are what will make this one of the most compelling shows of the decade.

                        <p> his season was slightly disjointed with Sam refocusing herself on her major project and not the station, but still potent as ever. This show feels less disruptive, but maybe because it is starting to gain some competition, which is ultimately a good thing. There is so much to love about Dear White People, but my favorite is the fake shows inside the show. This season was ripe with them. The Handmaids Tale parody and Tyler Perry were spectacular, but United States Of Gay took it for me. The Queer Eye take-off was simply amazing – hearing the fashion faux pas with a KKK cloak will never not be funny.

                        <p>here is something particularly charming about I Think You Should Leave. It has its hits and misses, but the concept of the show and sketch set ups are so refreshing. Ex SNL writer, Tim Robinson brings a lot of his rejected sketches to the Netflix show. They all have a common theme – a ridiculous character who does something absurd, a straight man calls them out, the scene turns on the straight man. It’s master writing (and I should know, I’ve taken UCB 101), in heightening and heightening to a ludicrous place. The best moment of I Think You Should Leave comes with Robinson not in the seat of insane person. He plays it very well, but sometimes stepping back and letting others do so, like the Will Forte plane sketch, let’s the writing shine and shows it isn’t reliant on his performance alone. The focus group sketch is the highlight of this show and if you don’t agree you have to marry your mother in law.

                        <p>he stand-out moment of 2019 comes from Ava Duvernay masterpiece, When They See Us. This isn’t a television show in that it is a cultural moment and should be treated like such. It is a heartbreaking piece of art. I read one Emmy voter didn’t vote for it because “it was too hard to finish” which is why he should have voted for it and why you should watch it. It shows humanity at its absolute fucking worst whilst showing the power human willpower like nothing else. I watch a fair few dramas and many haven’t made the list because I keep going back to compare it to this. Does the direction, actors, soundtrack and overall storytelling make me feel half the emotions this show does? And, honestly, it’s an impossible standard to hold any show to, because I don’t think it can ever be replicated. I was angry, I was devastated, I was crying in the shower after it. To take a story we all know and so many of us avoid speaking of and give the victims the respect they deserve, to be painted as the warriors they are. I picked Korey’s story as the moment of this momentous show, but it all could beat anything on this list. It’s fucking timely too, which is terrifying. Police brutality and the Trump ad, it’s not things of the past. Watch this. And if it’s “too hard” evaluate why. And then keep watching.

                        <p> y girl Laura Dern is truly the stand-out of this slightly underwhelming season. Sure, we were all excited for Streep’s addition, as it is our god given right, but don’t be distracted by the fact Renata is the only bitch worth worrying about. Meryl gave us the scream, and it was a great scream, but are we just going to pretend we weren’t blessed by such things like
                            I will not NOT be rich”, “can a woman get a moment”, when she destroyed her scumbag husbands toys and of course the My House lip sync that left us all quaking. Episode after episode, she acted her heart out to ultimately loose the 2020 Supporting Actress Emmy to Meryl, but I will never forget her. Or her daughter Amabella, (who has my favorite made up name), who had a panic attack because of global warming. Jane Fonda WHO?

                        <p> nitially, I was terrified by this show. It gave me flashbacks of myself watching Skins and believing I was Cassie because I was blonde and had an eating disorder and was into the ugliest guy in my school. I glamorized my condition because of this show, at no fault of the programs, just because it was a show about teens not necessarily made for teens – and I was scared of this doing the same. But then I remembered I also thought the episode of Glee where they got drunk because of Kesha was cool and couldn’t wait until me and my friends had basement karaoke drunk parties. My point is, if teens are going to watch shows about teenagers with mature scenes, I’m glad this show exists. Every character is treated with respect, it has representation that isn’t forced but is so uncommon in mainstream culture and it treats every potentially dangerous situation with the gravity appropriate. I love that this show has a character we all can relate to, and we pretend we are Madison’s, but we know we are all Lexi. Her as Bob Ross for Halloween perfectly highlights how most of us were in high school even though we like to imagine we were LSD taking leather wearing bad asses.

Anyone who is saying SNL isn’t good anymore, a raise you Bowen Yang. This shining star blossomed from writer to featured player. He is Asian. He is gay. And he is fucking hilarious. He has stolen scenes with one line (watch Little Miss Teachers Pet and First Impression Court) and is the toxic we NEED in this community. Honestly, every week during the opening credits, I wave back to him as he swings his hand from that fucking stupid vessel thing.

                        <P> BC’s first episode with the ex-fox comedy, Brooklyn Nine-Nine brings a new fresh breathe of air to the show. The beeped out curses are *air kiss* and the new gags along with it. ‘Pineapple Slut’ is the peak of it for me. When his baggage is lost, Holt must buy gift shop t-shirts giving us the perfect conversation between him and Andy Sandburg regarding who the slut is, the pineapple or the person wearing the shirt. That just felt like dialogue in a watch mojo video, what am I doing, did I just write this one to tell you dear listener that I have a Pineapple Slut shirt myself I ordered when this episode aired. Maybe. But also because Andre is perfect.

                        <P> uca & Bertie has been described as ‘the female Bojack but not as dark’ by many, a descriptor I despise. I just find it untrue. If Bojack takes a pessimistic approach to society, Tuca & Bertie is its optimistic sister. Maybe that’s because women have always been told to be more pleasant the characters reflected this, but I do believe it is because this is how you feel when you have girlfriends on your side. To say this show isn’t depressing is a straight up lie though. Episode Nine is heart wrenching. But maybe, we don’t take it as serious because it deals with female centric issues. I do really like Bojack, I just think the show has been undersold as a ‘happy version’ of Mr. Horseman. Tuca & Bertie is much more than that. The female friendship has not been explored in such a nuance way. The moment I’ve selected comes from the pilot and it’s a simple one. Tuca flashed her big old titties after admiring the view and Bertie hesitates and doesn’t. The character development in that move alone tells you so much about these two. The look of admiration but also self-awareness Bertie has is better character development than any female character in 8 seasons of Entourage, and it comes from a fucking cartoon bird.

                        <P>he season premier is one of the most mature way this has been confronted. It is a nuance take on complex issue, in an environment mainstream media rarely tackles it in- the school yard. There is a lot to unpack and discuss in this issue, and there are many people who could do so more eloquently than I, but I’ve targeted Missy’s storyline for the top moment. Missy decides to participate in the slut walk, but after speaking to her parents realizes the most liberating outfit she has is her little minion looking get-up. She is berated by the women at school for being anti-feminist and against their movement. The brilliant voice acting by the perfect specimen, Jenny Slate, encompasses the awkwardness one feels when approaching their sexual side and societal pressures of how women should feel ‘sexy’. This show can get dumb and make you say “hey did everyone want to fuck their cousin or just like one guy in the writer room because I don’t remember that part of my childhood…” but this episode, similar to the birth control one of season two, attacks the issue in an analytical and constructive way. I showed impartialness as a journalist in this one because my favorite moment is clearly when Richard Kind sings the theme song, but I didn’t want to push my opinion on everyone, even though everyone should love Richard Kind as much as I do. Look at this picture of us together!

                        <P> lack luster season eleven of Rupaul is still miles better than any other reality competition on television. This round saw a lot of forgettable queens, some questionable editing and boring challenges. But in the darkness came the sequin runway. Brooke Lynn Hytes had just bombed her snatch game, absolutely butchered Celine Dion. She knew she was done for. And then she pulled out a runway like no other, twirling, death dropping, kicking and basically popping her pussy left, right and center. This may be the most sickening runway in recent time but I argue it will earn its place in herstory. To this point, comedy queens have always been able to play it up on the runway, pageant queens have their looks, but dance queens have to just wait to be put in the bottom two and then show their lip sync assassin skills. The performative element of runway is back. It’s not a filler part anymore! Editor’s note: A close second was when Miss Vanji was told after an acting challenge by Ross “Meryl Streep, you are not” and she replied “what dat?”

                        <P>his year a youtube star named Ninja went on a singing contest called the Masked Singer as an ice cream and sang a song called Old Town Road by Billy Ray Cyrus and a cute gay guy by the name of Lil Nas. This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever written and I refuse to entertain this further. It may not be what you consider to be the best moment in television, but it is the moment 2019 deserves.
